                LEIDIA is a project dedicated to exploring the intersection of digital art and textures inspired by leather. Through various artistic mediums, we aim to transform the rich and tactile feeling of leather into stunning visual compositions. Our work delves into the intricate patterns, subtle color variations, and unique character of this material, reinterpreting it in a modern, digital context. We believe that the essence of a material can be captured and reimagined in the digital realm, creating a new form of art that is both familiar and innovative.
